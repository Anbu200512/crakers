    id: 'faq-enquiry-vs-order',
    question: 'Is placing an enquiry the same as placing an order?',
    answer: 'No. An enquiry is a request for pricing, availability and pack details. Our team confirms the final price, quantity and delivery plan with you before anything is reserved or billed.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-price',
    question: 'Why do you show NET RAT instead of a fixed price?',
    answer: 'The supplied order sheet has separate RATE and NET RAT columns. We show NET RAT as an indicative catalog value and keep RATE on the product page so nothing is hidden. The confirmed selling price is shared with you in the reply to your enquiry.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-availability',
    question: 'Can I confirm stock before I enquire?',
    answer: 'The sheet does not include stock quantities, so availability is always confirmed by our team. Send an enquiry with the listings you are interested in and we will reply with the current position.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-payment',
    question: 'How do I pay?',
    answer: 'There is no online payment in this phase. Once your enquiry is confirmed, we agree the amount and the payment method directly with you.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-combo-packs',
    question: 'What is a combo pack?',
    answer: 'A combo pack is a suggested grouping of catalog listings we built from the sheet. It is a starting point for your enquiry, not a fixed bundle price. You can remove or add any listing before sending it.',
  },
  {
    id: 'faq-safety',
    question: 'What safety guidance do you follow?',
    answer: 'Fireworks are used only in open outdoor areas, away from structures and dry vegetation, always under adult supervision, and only where local rules permit. Please read the safety page before your celebration.',
